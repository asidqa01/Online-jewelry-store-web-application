# Online-jewellry-store-web-application
web based online jewelry store named elements, implementing using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The aim is to develop a unified web-based E-Commerce jewelry store. Customers can access the system through the website and explore the available products. 
Since Human Computer Interaction (HCI) has moved beyond simply designing for desktop use, the website will also allow the user to access the website through multiple devices such as laptop, smartphone, as well as tablet i.e. with a view to responsive design and a screen reader option will make the website more accessible<br/><br/>

## Achitecture
• The Main website where an anonymous user can surf and register has 10 pages. 
• Upon hovering over these navbar elements, the subcategories are toggled below and the respective subcategories vary for each element. 
  In order for the navbar to be responsive the mobile view contains the menu button, which on clicking the navbar elements slide into view.
  The subcategories slide into view upon pressing the right arrow button, and slide out of view upon pressing the left arrow button.<br/><br/>
